# Golem: The Executable Dream

**Golem** is not another chatbot or LLM.  
It is a pre-configured agent that receives natural human intent, translates it into structured JSON via a unified MCP schema, and executes it.

- 🧠 No mouth: Golem never speaks — it acts.
- 🕊️ Not a conversation — but a bridge from vision to execution.
- 🔒 Offline-ready, secure-by-default.
- 🧱 Driven by an external control layer (MCP) for validation and actuation.

> In a world of talking bots, Golem is a listening worker.
